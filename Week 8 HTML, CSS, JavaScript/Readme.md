# CS50 2020 - Lecture 8 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This lecture introduces the foundational web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The lecture covers how HTML structures the content of web pages using elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, and forms. The focus is on understanding the role of HTML in defining the semantics and layout of a webpage.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): The CSS section explains how to style and format HTML content, focusing on concepts such as selectors, properties, and values. It demonstrates how CSS is used to control the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall appearance of web pages, enhancing the user experience.

JavaScript: JavaScript is introduced as the scripting language that makes web pages interactive and dynamic. The lecture explains how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), handle events, and create responsive elements on web pages.

The lecture also emphasizes the importance of separating content (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) for maintainable and efficient web development. The practical aspects include coding demonstrations and examples to reinforce the understanding of these technologies working together to build modern web applications.
